         <summary> TLS Encryption</summary>

* SSL Came first time in 1994. They build a specific navigator inside their browsers that other browsers didnt have and encorporated into thier browser. 
* In 1999 Microsoft found they need it but didnt want to use the name SSL from Netscape so they named it TLS but people still saying SSL. After all we have TLSv1.3 and enabled in browsers.
