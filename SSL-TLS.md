         <summary> TLS Encryption</summary>

* SSL Came first time in 1994. They build a specific navigator inside their browsers that other browsers didnt have and encorporated into thier browser. 
* In 1999 Microsoft found they need it but didnt want to use the name SSL from Netscape so they named it TLS but people still saying SSL. After all we have TLSv1.3 and enabled in browsers. 
 * Data Encryption , Key Exchange and Handshake  are three main parts of TLS
 #### Data Encryption
 * Protocols are the ones that encrypt data. 3des(168 bits) means des uses 3 times encryptign data with 3 secret keys. Then AES (128 or 256 bits) came in which is US government standard protocl now.
